## How to use it

You should now have this icon ![extension logo](icons/auth19.png) installed in your browser. Click it.

If you are **not** logged in to Coursera, it will tell you so and ask you to log in.

If you **are** logged in to Coursera, it will give you an option to copy the authentication code. Click that button, and 
you can use it as the CAUTH code that is added [in this (open) pull request](https://github.com/coursera-dl/coursera-dl/pull/724).
